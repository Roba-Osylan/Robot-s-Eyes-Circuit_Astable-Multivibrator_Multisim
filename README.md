# Robot-s-Eyes-Circuit_Astable-Multivibrator_Multisim
The purpose of this project is first to design a circuit that builds the eyes of the robot such that it goes off for some time without being detected by humans’ eyes in order to decrease power consumption. And then to design a circuit that power the robot’s eyes circuit that was designed using voltage regulator.
